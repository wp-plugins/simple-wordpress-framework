== Installation ==

This Plugin works without you having to make any changes. But we recommend that you customize it as described below, before you begin using it in a live setting.

1. Download the Plugin from this website. 
1. Change the [Standard Plugin Information Header](http://codex.wordpress.org/Writing_a_Plugin#File_Headers) at the beginning of the `swpframework.php` file, between lines 3 through 8.  Read the [WordPress API](http://codex.wordpress.org/Writing_a_Plugin#File_Headers) article, it provides a detailed explanation on how to do this. 
1. Choose a **`title`** for your Plugin, the current title for this Plugin is `'SWP Framework'`.  You can give it any name you want, `'Customer List'`, `'Time-Slips'`, `'The Weather Forecaster'`, etc. 
1. Choose a **`file/function`** name for this Plugin, the current name is `swpframework`.  Make sure you use lower case letters, keep it as short as possible, and remove all special characters and spaces from it.  Following the **`title`** examples above, you could use, `'customerlist'`, `'timeslips'`, `'weatherforcaster'`.
1. Use your PHP editor and perform the following tasks to all the files within you Plugin directory.<ul><li>Perform a 'Find and Replace' with 'Match Case' checked, and replace all instances of '`SWP Framework`' with the new **`title`** of your Plugin.  This **`title`** is used throughout the Plugin for error messages, alerts, and notes.</li><li>Perform a 'Find and Replace' with 'Match Case' checked, and replace all instances of '`swpframework`' with the new **name** of your Plugin.</li></ul>
1. Rename the file names below with your new **`file/function`** name.<BR><ul><li>`swpframework.php` --> **`file/function`**.php</li><li>`swpframework_farbtastic.js` --> **`file/function`**_farbtastic.js</li></ul>
1. Icons: the '`/swpframework/images`' directory contains four '`icon`' folders that occupy about 13MB of space.  We recommend that you move all the icons used in your Plugin from these folders to the '`/swpframework/images`' directory. Then remove the `icon.html` file, and all the `icon` folders that are in the `images` directory.  They have been placed there for your reference, and SWP Framework does not use them.  
1. Upload the '`swpframework`' folder to the '`/wp-content/plugins/`' directory
1. Rename the directory of this Plugin from '`swpframework`' to your new **`file/function name`**.
1. Activate the Plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress


Make sure you change the *VERSION NUMBER* every time you make changes to the Plugin.

* First Release, it is in Beta, and should be available as version 1.0.0 on November 1st, 2009.  Please do not rate this Plugin, since it's just in the beginning stages of its release.  I would appreciate as much help as possible, even if it's an e-mail telling me about a spelling mistake, grammatical error, description change or even a change in the code.  This is a simple program, and it was intentionally design without PHP Class structures for both beginner and advanced programmers who simply want to create something quickly.
